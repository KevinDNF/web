	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Rank busters is a game demo I created for my A-Level Computer
	Science coursework and the art assets where used on my Graphics
	Coursework. It's programmed in Monkey-X utilizing the mojo2
	libraries.
	<p>The demo has been programmed and tested on Windows 7 and requires the
	Ted (Original Monkey-X IDE) to be installed for the audio to work.
	<h2>Why Monkey-X ?</h2>
	<p>Monkey-X was not the best programming language for a game of this scale
	so why did I used it? Simple answer. Our teacher at the time told us to
	use it. His reasoning was that the language was so obscure that the
	examiners would have no clue how it works and would struggle marking
	the coursework resulting in higher grades.
	<h2>Gameplay</h2>
	<p>The game was meant to be a Smash Bros copy-cat with original
	characters but similar gameplay. Due to time limitations I was only
	able to design 2 characters and implement 1 with a very basic
	attack.

	<h2>Graphics</h2>
	I was heavily inspired by The Worlds Ends with You NDS game.
	<h2>Characters</h2>
	<p>The characters would each use ordinary items that have different
	abilities to attack. 
	<p>Jennid would use her extensible scarf to grab
	opponents or just hit them.
	<p>Nor would use his pen to throw ink to his enemies and draw other items
	he could interact with.
	<h2>Side notes</h2>
	I encontered some limitations due to the fact that Monkey-X was still
	in development and some things did not work out of the box forcing me to
	find weird workarounds. The whole experience was really fun even if the
	end result didn't end up as I wanted it to be.
	<p>Monkey-X got later updated to Monkey2 and is still in
	development. I would love to port it to Monkey2 or a more developed
	language so that I can finish the game at some point.
