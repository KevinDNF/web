	<h1>About</h1>
	Astrodroid is a game I developed for a python competition at
	University of Portsmouth. The competition had heavy limitiations in which
	we could not use Classes or libraries other that zelle's Graphics.py.

	<p>We also had to base it on one of the two games the lecturer
	provided us. 

	<h1>Sample Games</h1>
	Android chasing apples
	<p><b>Video</b>
	<p>Pong
	<p><b>Video</b>

	<h1>Plan</h1>
	I decided to create a platformer game that would utilize the
	floating mechanics of the "Android Chasing Apples" game and normal
	platformer mechanics.
	<p>The player would control an android with a jetpack that can be
	toggled on or off to change from normal platformer mechanics to
	floating mechanics. But to make it harder once the jetpack is on it
	would keep going upwards until toggled off. 
	<p>I was going to use what I have learned from making Rank Busters to
	generate maps from files to create a maze in which the android had to
	avoid spikes to get to the apples or could just go to the exit with a
	lower score.
	<p>My main focus was gameplay as I didn't wanted to have nice
	looking graphics without good gameplay to go with it
	(rankbusters...).

	I then improved the graphics, cleaned the code and expanded the levels
	so that the user can add more levels without touching the code.
