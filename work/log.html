		<h1 id="1">Introduction</h1>
		<p>This document is a in-progress log of all the things I've learned in
			 Web Fundation at University of Porstmouth. I will also include
			 all the extra knowledge I have gathered outside of lectures
			 related to web fundation.
		<h1 id="2">Virtual Machines</h1>
		<p>In out first practical we where introduced to our Virtual
		Machines which we will be using for our coursework website and
		database design.
		The virtual machine was running a version of linux and we had to access
		it via SSH using a shell chrome extension. This was my first
		interaction with a linux shell so I experimented with a couple of
		commands.
		<div class="html">
			<p><em>help</em> "Displays the possible commands"
			<p><em>man</em> program "Display a program's manual" 
			<p><em>cd</em> path "Changes directory to a path. If no path is set it
			changes back to the home folder."
			<p><em>mkdir</em> path "Makes a directory."
			<p><em>ls</em> "Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
			Has lots of parameters like -a which shows invisible
			files/directories."
		</div>
		<h1>Website awards</h1>
		<p>We also filled out a form of what we think are the best and worst
		website we have seen throught out the web. I nominated <a
			 href="www.liamwong.com">LiamWong.com</a> since I really liked the
		 design and aesthetics he has gone for in his web portfolio. 
	  <p>Navigating github I also found some interesting web portfolio that I
		could use as reference for when I will be designing my website for the
		coursework.
		<a href="todperry.ninja">TodPerry.ninja</a> caught my attention, being
		a bash terminal simulation with vim editing a python file. I really
		liked the idea and execution since you could use vim commands and
		interact with the shell enviroment. A really unique and well
		designed website.

		<h1>HTML 5</h1>
		<p>When creating a website the most basic languages used are HTML
		and CSS. On the following weeks we were introduced to HTML and CSS more
		specifically to HTML5, which has been taught for years and is the
		current standard for HTML documents.
		<p>HTML is the content part of the website, so all the writting and
		semantic structure is defined on the HTML file. It is necessary that
		this conventions are followed to avoid not following the correct
		standards. 
		<p>In our practicals we created our first HTML document and we learned that to show that
		the .html document is written in HTML5 we had to use a special tag at
		the top of the docuement so that browsers know what to expect.

		<div class="html">
			<em>
			&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
			</em>
		</div>
		<p>I experimented with the tags I knew already and some other new
		ones.
		<div class="html">
			
		<p><em>&lt;p&gt; Hello world &lt;/p&gt; </em> Used for new paragraphs.
		<p><em>&lt;h1&gt; Heading 1 &lt;/h1&gt; </em> Heading 1
		<p><em>&lt;ol&gt; </em> Start of ordered list
		<p><em>&lt;li&gt; Enumerated Item 1 &lt;li&gt;</em> Item
		<p><em>&lt;li&gt; Enumerated Item 2 &lt;li&gt;</em> Item
		<p><em>&lt;/ol&gt;</em> End of ordered list
		</div>
		
		<p>We also covered some deprecated tags that we should avoid at all
		cost. 
		<div class="html">
			<em>&lt;br&gt;</em>
		</div>

		<p>br was used for new lines, but we shouldn't need to use it since the
		html file is the content of the webpage, if we want to have a larger
		seperations between paragraphs we can do that via CSS.

		<h2>Closing tags</h2>
		<p>HTML is quite a curious language in which we can do completly wrong
		and bad things and still have the page display the way we want it,
		this is because browsers can work with bad code but they will
		struggle with it... so its not recommended. 
		<p>But one of the things that it is recommended is to ommit
		unecessary closing tags. Like the closing  &lt;p&gt; is not always
		necessary to writte since a new &lt;p&gt; tag will close previous
		one. Google has a <a
			 href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Optional_Tags">website</a> where they describe what kind of tags are ok
		to ommit to have a smaller file size and easier to read. 

		<p>Most of my
		code will follow googles standard... so don't mark me down for
		"missing closing tags" or stuff like that. U.U
		<h2>Validators</h2>
		<p>We were also introduced to validators, which are websites that
		check your html and css code and return any errors/warnings it finds.
		Similar to how an IDE will display errors.
		<p>One of our requirements for our website is that it has to be valid
		html so we are not allowed a single error.

		<h1>CSS 3</h1>
		<p>CSS is the styling of the webpage, how it looks and how it
		reflows. There are two main ways of implementing css. 

		<h2>Inline styling</h2>
		<p>Using the style attribute inside a tag can add style to a specific
		element. But by doing this we are styling each element
		specifically, so really big documents will require a stupid amount
		of time to correctly style.
		<div class="html">
			<em>&lt;p style:background-color=</em>"red"<em>;&gt;</em>Some text
		</div>
		<p>Which is why it is not recommended to use.

		<h2>External Style Sheet</h2>
		<p>We can style every element in a page by using an external style sheet,
		which is usually a <em>something.css</em> containing css.
		<div class="html">
			<p>HTML
			<p><em>&lt;p&gt;</em>Some text
		</div>
		<div class="html">
			<p>CSS
			<em>
			<p>p{
			<p>background-color:</em>red<em>;
			<p>}
			</em>
		</div>
		<p>This is really usefull as we can have 1 css file linked to many html
		pages and have a consistent web design. So if we want to change one
		thing on every page we only have to edit 1 file.
		
		<p>To link an style sheet file to an html document we have to use
		the following line in our head section.
		<div class="html">
		<p><em>&lt;link rel=</em>"stylesheet"
			<em>href=</em>"../style.css"<em>&gt;</em>
		</div>
		<p>Where "../style.css" is the path to the file.

		<h1>HTML Structure</h1>
		<h2>Head</h2>
		<p>Every html document has a head section, in which important
		information is defined like title, meta tags and links to
		stylesheets/scripts.
		<p>This informatin is not showned in the page but it is used for
		other necessary actions the webpage will perform.
		<div class="html">
			<p><em>&lt;meta charset=</em>"utf-8"<em>&gt;</em>
			<p><em>&lt;meta name=</em>"author"
			<em>content=</em>"UP849868"<em>&gt;</em>
			<p><em>&lt;meta name=</em>"viewport"
			<em>content=</em>"width=device-width,
			initial-scale=1.0"<em>&gt;</em>
			<p><em>&lt;link rel=</em>"shortcut icon" <em>type=</em>"image/png"
			<em>href=</em>"../images/logoInverted.png"<em>&gt;</em>
			<p><em>&lt;link rel=</em>"stylesheet"
			<em>href=</em>"../style.css"<em>&gt;</em>
		</div>
		<p>The <b>meta</b> tag are used for metadata.
		<p>The <b>link</b> tag are used to link other files like
		stylesheets or javascript.
		
		<p>The <b>charset</b> is the encoding used on the page. In this case
		I'm using standard utf-8
		<p><b>Viewport</b> is used for compatibility with mobile devices or
		small screens. The viewport meta tag has tons of functionality and
		will require further research to explain it fully.
		<p>the <b> rel="shortcut icon"</b> is used to display a favicon image
		in the tab's browsers.

		<h2>Body - Semantic Markup</h2>
		Its important that the body of the html document follows good
		semantic markup to ensure that the webpage can be read by
		screenreaders.
		<div class="html">
				<p><em>&lt;article&gt;</em>
				<p><em>&lt;header&gt;</em>
				<p><em>&lt;/header&gt;</em>
				<p><em>&lt;section&gt;</em>
				<p><em>&lt;/section&gt;</em>
				<p><em>&lt;footer&gt;</em>
				<p><em>&lt;/footer&gt;</em>
				<p><em>&lt;/article&gt;</em>
		</div>	


		<h1>Pictures and images</h1>
			<div class="html">
				<p><em>&lt;picture&gt;
				<p>&lt;source srcset=</em>"images/icons/github.svg"<em>&gt;
				<p>&lt;img src=</em>"images/icons/github.png"<em>
				alt=</em>"github"<em>&gt;
				<p>&lt;picture&gt;
				</em>
			</div>

		<h1>Accessibility</h1>
		<p>In our lecture and practical we were introduced to
		accessibility. We looked at some not accesible websites and they
		pointed at things we should take into consideration.

		<h1>Standards</h1>	
		<div class="html">
			<p><em>body, article, section, nav, aside, header, footer.</em></p>
		</div>

		<h1>Relative and Absolute Links</h1>
		<h2>Absolute links</h2>
		<h2>Relative links</h2>
		<h1>Media Queries</h1>
		<h1>Flex-Box</h1>
		<h1>Advance CSS selectors</h1>
		<h1>Video</h1>
		<video controls id="video-container">
			<source src="../videos/yetris.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			<source src="../videos/yetris.mkv" type="video/mkv">
			<source src="../videos/yetris.mpeg" type="video/mpeg">
			<source src="../videos/yetris.webm" type="video/webm">
			<track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="videos/yetris.vtt" default>
