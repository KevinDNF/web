		<h1 id="1">Introduction</h1>
		<p>This document is a in-progress log of all the things I've learned in
			 Web Fundation at University of Porstmouth. I will also include
			 all the extra knowledge I have gathered outside of lectures
			 related to web fundation.
		<h1 id="2">Virtual Machines</h1>
		<p>In out first practical we where introduced to our Virtual
		Machines which we will be using for our coursework website and
		database design.
		The virtual machine was running a version of linux and we had to access
		it via SSH using a shell chrome extension. This was my first
		interaction with a linux shell so I experimented with a couple of
		commands.
		<div class="html">
			<p>help <span>"Displays the possible commands"</span>
			<p>man <em>program</em> <span>"Display a program's manual" </span>
			<p>cd <em>path</em> <span>"Changes directory to a path. If no path is set it
				changes back to the home folder."</span>
			<p>mkdir <em>path</em> <span>"Makes a directory."</span>
			<p>ls <span>"Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
			Has lots of parameters like -a which shows invisible
			files/directories."</span>
		</div>
		<h1>Website awards</h1>
		<p>We also filled out a form of what we think are the best and worst
		website we have seen throught out the web. I nominated <a
			 href="www.liamwong.com">LiamWong.com</a> since I really liked the
		 design and aesthetics he has gone for in his web portfolio. 
	  <p>Navigating github I also found some interesting web portfolio that I
		could use as reference for when I will be designing my website for the
		coursework.
		<a href="todperry.ninja">TodPerry.ninja</a> caught my attention, being
		a bash terminal simulation with vim editing a python file. I really
		liked the idea and execution since you could use vim commands and
		interact with the shell enviroment. A really unique and well
		designed website.

		<h1>HTML 5</h1>
		<p>When creating a website the most basic languages used are HTML
		and CSS. On the following weeks we were introduced to HTML and CSS more
		specifically to HTML5, which has been taught for years and is the
		current standard for HTML documents.
		<p>HTML is the content part of the website, so all the writting and
		semantic structure is defined on the HTML file. It is necessary that
		this conventions are followed to avoid not following the correct
		standards. 
		<p>In our practicals we created our first HTML document and we learned that to show that
		the .html document is written in HTML5 we had to use a special tag at
		the top of the docuement so that browsers know what to expect.

		<div class="html">
			&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
		</div>
		<p>I experimented with the tags I knew already and some other new
		ones.
		<div class="html">
			
			<p>&lt;p&gt; Hello world &lt;/p&gt; <span> Used for new
				paragraphs.</span>
			<p>&lt;h1&gt; Heading 1 &lt;/h1&gt; <span> Heading 1</span>
			<p>&lt;ol&gt; <span> Start of ordered list</span>
			<p>&lt;li&gt; Enumerated Item 1 &lt;li&gt;<span> Item</span>
			<p>&lt;li&gt; Enumerated Item 2 &lt;li&gt;<span> Item</span>
			<p>&lt;/ol&gt;<span> End of ordered list</span>
		</div>
		
		<p>We also covered some deprecated tags that we should avoid at all
		cost. 
		<div class="html">
			&lt;br&gt;
		</div>

		<p>br was used for new lines, but we shouldn't need to use it since the
		html file is the content of the webpage, if we want to have a larger
		seperations between paragraphs we can do that via CSS.

		<h2>Closing tags</h2>
		<p>HTML is quite a curious language in which we can do completly wrong
		and bad things and still have the page display the way we want it,
		this is because browsers can work with bad code but they will
		struggle with it... so its not recommended. 
		<p>But one of the things that it is recommended is to ommit
		unecessary closing tags. Like the closing  &lt;p&gt; is not always
		necessary to writte since a new &lt;p&gt; tag will close previous
		one. Google has a <a
			 href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Optional_Tags">website</a> where they describe what kind of tags are ok
		to ommit to have a smaller file size and easier to read. 

		<p>Most of my
		code will follow googles standard... so don't mark me down for
		"missing closing tags" or stuff like that. U.U
		<h2>Validators</h2>
		<p>We were also introduced to validators, which are websites that
		check your html and css code and return any errors/warnings it finds.
		Similar to how an IDE will display errors.
		<p>One of our requirements for our website is that it has to be valid
		html so we are not allowed a single error.

		<h1>CSS 3</h1>
		<p>CSS is the styling of the webpage, how it looks and how it
		reflows. There are two main ways of implementing css. 

		<h2>Inline styling</h2>
		<p>Using the style attribute inside a tag can add style to a specific
		element. But by doing this we are styling each element
		specifically, so really big documents will require a stupid amount
		of time to correctly style.
		<div class="html">
			&lt;p style:background-color=<span>"red"</span>;&gt;Some text
		</div>
		<p>Which is why it is not recommended to use.

		<h2>External Style Sheet</h2>
		<p>We can style every element in a page by using an external style sheet,
		which is usually a <em>something.css</em> containing css.
		<div class="html">
			<p>HTML
			<p>&lt;p&gt;<span>Some text</span>
		</div>
		<div class="html">
			<p>CSS
			<p>p{
			<p>background-color:<span>red</span>;
			<p>}
		</div>
		<p>This is really usefull as we can have 1 css file linked to many html
		pages and have a consistent web design. So if we want to change one
		thing on every page we only have to edit 1 file.
		
		<p>To link an style sheet file to an html document we have to use
		the following line in our head section.
		<div class="html">
			<p>&lt;link rel=<span>"stylesheet"</span>
			href=<span>"../style.css"</span>&gt;
		</div>
		<p>Where "../style.css" is the path to the file.

		<h1>HTML Structure</h1>
		<h2>Head</h2>
		<p>Every html document has a head section, in which important
		information is defined like title, meta tags and links to
		stylesheets/scripts.
		<p>This informatin is not showned in the page but it is used for
		other necessary actions the webpage will perform.
		<div class="html">
			<p>&lt;meta charset=<span>"utf-8"</span>&gt;
			<p>&lt;meta name=<span>"author"</span>
			content=<span>"UP849868"</span>&gt;
			<p>&lt;meta name=<span>"viewport"</span>
			content=<span>"width=device-width,
			initial-scale=1.0"</span>&gt;
			<p>&lt;link rel=<span>"shortcut icon" </span>type=<span>"image/png"
			</span>href=<span>"../images/logoInverted.png"</span>&gt;
			<p>&lt;link rel=<span>"stylesheet"</span>
			href=<span>"../style.css"</span>&gt;
		</div>
		<p>The <b>meta</b> tag are used for metadata.
		<p>The <b>link</b> tag are used to link other files like
		stylesheets or javascript.
		
		<p>The <b>charset</b> is the encoding used on the page. In this case
		I'm using standard utf-8
		<p><b>Viewport</b> is used for compatibility with mobile devices or
		small screens. The viewport meta tag has tons of functionality and
		will require further research to explain it fully.
		<p>the <b> rel="shortcut icon"</b> is used to display a favicon image
		in the tab's browsers.

		<h2>Body - Semantic Markup</h2>
		Its important that the body of the html document follows good
		semantic markup to ensure that the webpage can be read by
		screenreaders.
		<div class="html">
				<p>&lt;nav&gt;
				<p>&lt;/nav&gt;
				<p>&lt;article&gt;
				<p>&lt;header&gt;
				<p>&lt;/header&gt;
				<p>&lt;section&gt;
				<p>&lt;/section&gt;
				<p>&lt;footer&gt;
				<p>&lt;/footer&gt;
				<p>&lt;/article&gt;
		</div>	
		<p>A well defined website will have a good semantic structure meaning
		each part of the website has its corresponding tag. So the header
		elements will be enclosed in a header tag, the main will be enclosed in
		the main.
		<p><b>Articles</b> are used for blog post like documents and other form
		of repetitive content.
		<p><b>Sections</b> are sections inside articles or just the main
		<p><b>Main</b> is where the main content of the webpage goes to
		<p><b>Footer and Header</b> is as standard documents have header and
		footer. The important part of these elements is that the html document
		will have a header and footer and articles will have a header and
		footer meaning we can utilized them in many different other semantic
		tags.
		<p><b>Nav</b> is used for navigation of the website.

		<h1>Pictures and images</h1>
		<p>On html5 the introduction of the <b>picture</b> tag was quite a big
			change to the image world, since before it was the only way of
			implementing images.
			<p>The <b>img</b> tag is used to add an image to a webpage. This can
			be of any image format and is essential that it contains a good
			descriptive alternative tag. This alternative text will be displayed
			if the image fails to load and has been a html requirement to avoid
			having unwelcoming sites to screenreaders.
			<p>Being able to add images is great but with the introduction of the
			<b>Picture</b> tag we can do a lot more. With the picture tag we can
			add many sources to a single image meaning that if one of them fails
			to load because it's not supported or other reason then a second
			source will load. This can be achieved using the type tag inside the
			souce tag.
			<p>Instead of just defining different sources in case it fails there
			is also the feature of using media queries within the <b>picture</b>
			tag so that a different image loads at a specific screen size or
			other queries.
			
			<div class="html">
				<p>&lt;picture&gt;
				<p>&lt;source srcset=<span>"images/icons/github.svg"</span>
				type=<span>"image/svg+xml"</span> &gt;
				<p>&lt;img src=<span>"images/icons/github.png"</span>
				alt=<span>"github"</span>&gt;
				<p>&lt;picture&gt;
			</div>

			<p>The crucial part of the picture tag is that it must contain either
			a media query or a type tag. 

		<h1>Accessibility</h1>
		<p>I have mentioned before that we must follow the standards and be 
		friendly to screen readers, all of this falls
		into the category of accessibility which is a massive topic.
		<p>Accessibility is allowing everyone to use the website which includes
		people with many problems to use it. So how can we ensure that a blind
		person can use our website? We use a variety of tools.
		<h2>Video transcripts</h2>
		<p>People with difficulty hearing whats happening on the screen might
		require some visual feedback from the video to fully understand what is
		happening. Which is why it is important to add subtitles to videos via
		a video transcript file, <em>transcript.vtt</em>. I have an example of
		this down below.
		<h2>Aria-label</h2>
		<p>Aria labels can be used to show how certain buttons are used.
		<h2>Colour</h2>
		<p>Colour choices are crucial for everyone to see. I have carefully
		selected the colours on this website to be as accessible as possible. A
		good example of a badly designed colourscheme can be seen in my first
		design of this website.
		<h2>Text-size</h2>
		<p>Font size is also a crucial factor. Usually you want to have it
		1rem to avoid changing the font size of the user preference.
		<h1>Standards</h1>	
		<h1>Relative and Absolute Links</h1>
		<h2>Absolute links</h2>
		Absolute Links are usually bad since they are a direct path to a
		devices directory. Something like
		<em>/home/MyCoolUserName/image.png</em>
		Would mean that it only works on that specific device
		<h2>Relative links</h2>
		Relative links are hyperlinks that are relative to the position of the
		file thats reading it. So if I place a file with <em>hello/world.png</em>
		then the image will only work on that specific device.
		<h1>Media Queries</h1>
		Try resizing the page. What happends to the navigation bar.
		<h1>Flex-Box</h1>
		Is good. And example of this can be seen at my homepage.
		<h1>Advance CSS selectors</h1>
		<h1>Video</h1>
		<video controls>
			<source src="../videos/yetris.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			<source src="../videos/yetris.mkv" type="video/mkv">
			<source src="../videos/yetris.mpeg" type="video/mpeg">
			<source src="../videos/yetris.webm" type="video/webm">
			<track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="../videos/yetris.vtt" default>
		</video>
		<h1>&lt;b&gt; vs &lt;strong&gt;</h1>
		<p>Due to the introduction of semantic markup we now have two ways of
		adding boldness to text but they are completly different in how they
		are meant to be implemented. The b tag is used as usual, for visual
		boldness but Strong is used to mark importance to text in a webpage
		level so that web crawlers or bots can use this tags to find what is
		important to the webpage.
