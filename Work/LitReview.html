		<h1>Mitigating corporate information on the web - 
		The implication of botnets in corporate cyber-security.</h1>
		</header>
		
		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>The aim of this paper is to present a short analysis of the
				current security flaws in corporations, by analysing modern
				techniques used by cybercriminals, their adaptation of
				botnets into cybercrimes and comparing existing solutions 
				employed by corporations.
		<h2>The importance of corporate security</h2>
		<p>Due to the increasing amount of data corporations hold and
				gather, a security concern from the public has risen, as the
				data organisations hold is no longer just stock quantities and
				record but instead personal user data. More and more 
				corporations require the user to register for an account to
				allow them to use their services or benefits, giving personal
				information and login details. This requires the customer to 
				trust organisation with their personal data. Studies have 
				shown that it is a challenge to regain the trust of customers
				after their data have been exposed. This is showed in (Whitler
				 & Farris, 2017) where they explain many cyber-attacks and its
				long-term impact including the more recent Target's attack
				which is estimated to have cost over $1 billion and 50 years 
				of trust. Therefore, it is imperative for organisations to 
				understand the vulnerabilities in their system and how 
				criminals, exploit these, to make sure that they are taking
				the correct precautions to avoid data leakage.

		<h2>Introduction to botnets and their impact on corporate security.
		</h2>	
		<p>As technology develops so does the techniques cybercriminals 
				use to break into systems, one way cybercriminals have 
				adapted to the modern technologies is by moving from malware 
				attacks to utilizing the processing power of multiple machines 
				around the world for their malicious tasks called botnets 
				(Schultz, 2006) which are a collection of infected machines 
				which have a program running the background with malicious 
				intends without the user knowledge. These programs work in 
				a command and control manner where the botherder is the 
				administrator who sends instructions to the other infected 
				machines known as zombies. The infected machines can then be 
				instructed to perform attacks against other machines or transmit 
				personal data outside of the company. (Elliott, 2010)
		
		<h2>The implications of botnets in account authentication
		attacks </h2>
		<p>It is common for employees to login into their cloud service or 
				private storage using a username and password, this user 
				credentials must be kept secure and confidential to avoid 
				having unauthorised access to the organisation’s data. This 
				point of entry can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain 
				access to their sensitive data.
		<h2>Brute force attacks</h2>
		<p>Criminals with the intent of breaking into someone's account 
				might first attempt to guess the account password, this 
				technique has greatly improved by the introduction of botnets 
				in which a more elaborate approach such as a brute force 
				attacks attack can be used. These attacks, are orchestrated 
				attacks in which the criminal will attempt to login into the 
				users' account by using a script that will test as many 
				passwords as it can in a very short time these passwords can 
				be generated using commonly used characters or with a 
				dictionary containing common passwords and words. Usually, 
				login services provide some protection against this by having 
				a maximum number of login attempts per computer which is why 
				botnets are used to counter this protection. (Elliott, 2010)
		
		<h2>Phishing attacks</h2>
		<p>If the password cannot be easily cracked criminals might opt 
				to use social engineering techniques to get personal data. 
				Phishing is a social engineering technique where the criminal 
				tricks someone into giving his personal information without 
				knowing the criminal intent, which is usually done tricking 
				the user into believing that he is giving the information to 
				a reputable source. This attack can be fake emails trying to 
				impersonate a company or impersonating an individual in which 
				the target user might trust, inside this email the criminal 
				might be asking for the user's personal information or make 
				them click on a fake website where they might use their login 
				details as if it was the real one. Phishing can be less direct 
				via a DNS spoofing attack where the domain lookup is compromised 
				so that it leads to the criminal website. (Issac & Chiong, 2006) 
				Since phishing requires to trick the user, targeted attacks are 
				not usually successful, but criminals will perform instead a 
				mass attack using botnets aimed at a lot of users.

		<h2>Comparing viable solutions against authentication 
		attacks</h2>
		<h2>Password strength</h2>
		<p>To minimize the chance of a brute force attacks from successfully
				guessing user passwords it is recommended by multiple sources 
				(Ji et al., 2017) & (Shen, Yu, Xu, Yang, & Guan, 2016) to use 
				longer passwords with characters from three or more symbol sets. 
				According to these studies, users tend to use passwords which 
				are more convenient to remember and are easier to type on a 
				standard keyboard. This means that criminals can build up a 
				dictionary based on these features and use previous password 
				leakage, like from the Yahoo incident (Whitler & Farris, 2017)
				allows them to easily crack them. Avoiding these common tropes 
				ensures that the password strength is secure enough to avoid a
				standard brute force attack.
		
		<h2>Phishing countermeasures</h2>
		<p>The most common technique to protect corporations from phishing 
				attacks is by training each stakeholder who has access to the 
				sensitive data login credentials so that they can identify 
				when an email or website might be fraudulent. This has been 
				previously tackled by performing rule-based training in which 
				the user will have to follow a set of rules in which include, 
				never clicking a link on an email or giving away information 
				without checking the validity of the request, employees 
				should also perform inspections of the website/email for the
				details that might prove that is fake before carrying on with 
				their task. (Issac, Chiong, & Jacob, 2014) but according to 
				(Jensen, Dinger, Wright, & Thatcher, 2017) research, the 
				overuse of this technique in the workplace has to lead the 
				employees with an overconfidence in analysing and identifying 
				phishing attacks leading them to be more susceptible to fail 
				at identifying a phishing attack. Instead, the paper 
				recommends using a mindful training, which promotes the idea 
				of pausing and focusing on the environment and situation to 
				avoid overconfidence. This combined with rule-based training 
				is their conclusion to the current problem with rule base 
				training. 	
		
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>In this paper, we described different techniques used by 
				cybercriminals, their adaptation to botnets to improve their 
				previous attacks and analysed different techniques employed 
				in the workplace. 

				We concluded that currently the best solutions to protect 
				from brute force attacks is by using long passwords 
				containing symbols from multiple character sets and that 
				overuse of training in the workplace can be 
				counterproductive. This paper shows that it is imperative 
				for organizations to stay up to date with possible security 
				flaws as technology advances so do criminal techniques to 
				bypass previous security.
