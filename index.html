	<h1>Welcome.</h1>
		<br>
		<p>This website has been created for my 
			 Web Foundation coursework at Portsmouth University. 
			 I plan on improving it as a "virtual CV" of my web 
			 programming and designing skills.
		<p> On the Work tab you will find the programming projects
		I'm working on and have worked in the past.
		<p> On the Art tab you will be able to see all the design projects 
		I have worked on.
		<p> If you want to know a bit about who I am you can see more information
		on the About page.</p>

		<h1>If you are here only to look at my 
			<b>LogBook</b> then you can find that</h1>

		<p> Im currently trying to learn as much html, css and javascript.
		I plan on finishing or at least have a presentable
		version of this website before the end of the holidays.
