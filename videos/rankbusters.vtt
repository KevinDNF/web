00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What you are currently looking at

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is RankBusters. Which is just my A-Level

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
coursework. Its meant to be a smash bros copycat

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but well... time limitations and other reasons

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
means its not finished and its filled with bugs.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The graphics where made by me aswell 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which are part of my Graphics A-level coursework

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The game is programmed in

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Monkey X

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
As you can see. When the player 1 first hits the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
opposite player first, nothing happends until the other

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
player gets hit... which is one bug of many.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The jumping mechanics have a lot to be desired.
