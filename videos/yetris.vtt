00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What you are currently looking at is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
terminal running yetris

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is a tetris copy made by

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
someone.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
At the bottom of the screen

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
you can see the software I'm using

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to record. ffmpeg

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which is just a terminal based video

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
capture/ convertor

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You may have noticed this doesn't look

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
like your standard Windows


00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that's because this is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
GNU\Linux or as some might prefer

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to call it...

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
GNU + Linux

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but either is fine.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
as long as its not just linux.
Becuase linux is not an operative system,
but instead the kernel of the operative system.
Linux by itself won't be able to run applications
but needs the GNU system to run on top for the 
operative system to be complete.
Well enought rambling. 
The video is over anyway. So you should not be able to read this.
Have a good day.
